**Title:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR) of TSX Files

**Type:** Task

**Priority:** High

**Reporter:** [Your Name]

**Assignee:** [Assignee Name]

**Description:**

We need to add server-side rendering (SSR) capability for TSX files in our application. This will improve the initial load time of our application and enhance SEO performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. TSX files can be rendered on the server.
2. The initial page load should display the server-rendered page.
3. Client-side hydration should take over after the initial page load.
4. The implementation should support routing and state management.
5. Proper error handling is in place for failed SSR attempts.

**Sub-Tasks:**

1. Research how to implement SSR with TSX files.
2. Implement SSR in a feature branch.
3. Write unit and integration tests for the SSR implementation.
4. Test the SSR implementation.
5. Review and merge the feature branch into the main branch.
6. Update internal and user-facing documentation to reflect the new SSR capability.

**Suggested Solutions:**

1. **Use a Framework:** Consider using a framework like Next.js that supports SSR out of the box.
2. **Custom Implementation:** If a framework is not an option, you could implement SSR manually. This would involve setting up a Node.js server to render the TSX files and send the HTML to the client.
3. **Hydration:** After the server-rendered page is displayed, client-side JavaScript should "hydrate" the page to add interactivity.
