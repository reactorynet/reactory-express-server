**Title:** Create Docker Image for Reactory Server Express

**Type:** Task

**Priority:** High

**Reporter:** [Your Name]

**Assignee:** [Assignee Name]

**Description:**

We need to create a Docker image for the Reactory Server Express application. This will allow us to easily distribute the application and ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. A Dockerfile is created that correctly builds an image of the Reactory Server Express application.
2. The Docker image can be run to start the application.
3. The Docker image includes all necessary dependencies for the application.
4. The Docker image is optimized for size and build time.
5. The Docker image is pushed to a Docker registry.

**Sub-Tasks:**

1. Research best practices for creating a Docker image for a Node.js application.
2. Write a Dockerfile for the Reactory Server Express application.
3. Build the Docker image and test it locally.
4. Optimize the Dockerfile for size and build time.
5. Push the Docker image to a Docker registry.
6. Update internal and user-facing documentation to include instructions for using the Docker image.

**Suggested Solutions:**

1. **Use a Multi-Stage Build:** To optimize the size of the Docker image, consider using a multi-stage build. This allows you to separate the build stage and the runtime stage, reducing the size of the final image.
2. **Use an Official Node.js Base Image:** Start with an official Node.js base image to ensure that Node.js and npm are correctly installed.
3. **Include a `.dockerignore` File:** To prevent unnecessary files from being included in the Docker image, create a `.dockerignore` file.
