# Reactory DSL 
Reactory comes with a built in DSL (dynamic scripting language) that allows engineers to streamline complex tasks using simple expressions. 

The DSL can be used during runtime to perform a variety of tasks and can be used as a shorthand language to perform a series of instructions on a data payload.

See the [specification](compiler/specification.md) file for more details on the specification of the DSL.
