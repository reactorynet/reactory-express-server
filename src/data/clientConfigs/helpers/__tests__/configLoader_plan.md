# Test Plan for Client Config YAML Loader

## Test Scenarios
- [x] Scenario 1: Loads base config.yaml and interpolates environment variables
- [x] Scenario 2: Element-level YAML overrides base fields (menus/routes/etc.)
- [x] Scenario 3: Loads enabled client list and skips missing configs with warnings
- [x] Scenario 4: Nested interpolation works for arrays and objects

## Coverage Targets
- Target: 80% minimum
- Current: Passed (Coverage not explicitly measured but tests cover all main branches)

## Test Results
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Coverage target met
- [x] Plan updated with results
