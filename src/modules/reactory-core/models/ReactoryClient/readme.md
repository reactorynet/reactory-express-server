# Reactory Client 
The Reactory Client Model is a key model for the platform. The client is referred to as the "partner" in the execution context and the name ReactoryClient is interchangable with partner.

## Configuration
Reactory Clients are configured in the `src/data/clientConfigs/` folder. Clients are only ingested at startup and there are no other ways of creating a client.
