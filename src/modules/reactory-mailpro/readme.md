What is mail pro

Combines the workflow, data source catalog and custom data pipelines with custom email templates configurable per organisation, business units, teams and user.  It prepares emails based on time and prepares them in draft (autosend can be enabled). It will collate data, package and zip. If too large for attachment, it will automatically insert a downloadble link that is token protected per user addressed.
