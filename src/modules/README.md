## Important Notice
All folders and files in the modules folder is ignored by the parent git repo, with the exception of the /core module

Modules will be kept in their own repo and will have to downloaded into the modules folder

Modules cannot have conflicting names thus if you plan to make your modules available for publishing 
please ensure you your module does not use an already taken name.  Where names conflict a custom remapping will have to be done as a work around but this is not guaranteed to work.

You will need an enabled<key>.json file that represent the available config
